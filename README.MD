Sample Vuforia AR project, second place winner of the Fashion Fusion competition 2016-2017, Berlin. Project by Tank Thunderbird, Antonio Ciutto and Christian Bruns. Past links and tweets about the contest can be found at https://twitter.com/mimemeAR and on my website.

To use, please register as a Vuforia developer, acquire a license code and paste it into the Vuforia Configuration window in Unity.

This is a simplified version of the project presented at the final show of Fashion Fusion 2017.

Print out the graphic marker to see the AR effect. It is currently setup to build as an Android app, it is tested on Unity version 5.5.4f1 . Change the build settings for other devices as required. Please note that several versions of Unity have issues building to Android, visit this link for more details, including current discussion on newer versions of teh Editor. https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-build-fails-when-the-latest-android-sdk-tools-25-dot-3-1-version-is-used?page=3#comments

A mobile  build can run as a mono or stereoscopic version, make sure to change the settings in the vuforia configuration window if that is desired. Not that building for mobile devices requires a bit of setup work, whether it is installing the sdks for Android and Java, or XCode and other iOS required tools.
