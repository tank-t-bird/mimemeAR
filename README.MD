To use, please register as a Vuforia developer, acquire a license code and paste it into the Vuforia Configuration window in Unity.

This is a paired down version of the final project presented at the final show of Fashion Fusion 2017.

Print out the graphic marker to see the AR effect. It is currently setup to build as a Mac App or just run it in Unity itself, this was built using version 5.5.1f1 . Change the build settings for other devices as required.

An android build can run as a mono or stereoscopic version, make sure to change the settings in the vuforia configuration window if that is desired. Not that building for Android requires the Android and the Java sdks.
